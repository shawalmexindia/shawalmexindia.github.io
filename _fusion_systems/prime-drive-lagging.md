PrimeDrive is the most unique, compatible lagging offered in years. It completely eliminates the grinding and cutting required to remove corroded lagging.

Features:
- Aircraft grade aluminum cores in a flexible wing design, fastened with self-tapping corrosion resistant bolts
- Fits on any diameter from 10" to 72" and on any face width, so a few pieces will cover the entire pulley
- Fastened with a pneumatic drill and socket driver, avoiding the use of burn permits and the risk of fire or explosion
- 2-3 hour change-outs, since hole pattern already exists
- Performance increases 200 to 300% in wear life over alternate systems, because the rubber compound has a high percentage of natural rubber
- Excellent traction due to superior rubber content and no gaps in the lagging
- At least 16% more lagging in contact with the belt at all times
- No need to inventory numerous pieces with varying radius
- A chop saw, T-square and drill are all that is needed to eliminate rusted-on lagging
- Large aggressive diamond profile material provided in strip rolls 5.5" wide and 70" long
