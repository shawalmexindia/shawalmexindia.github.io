  While there are many suppliers of pulley lagging and skirtboard rubber, most have sought to sacrifice quality and performance for sake of cost. Almex has taken a different strategy by offering a premium product with superior performance.

Shaw Almex has again led the industry with the introduction of a new line of wear and abrasion resistant rubber.

Utilizing breakthrough Kevlar® Engineered Elastomer from DuPontTM. Almex and DuPontTM have collaborated for over two years to bring to market the most advanced products in pulley lagging.

Almex has extended this technology into skirtboard rubber, tank and pipe lining. DupontTM Kevlar® Engineered Elastomer is a dispersion of a highly branched para-aramid pulp available in a family of rubber matrices. Based on a proprietary technology, it opens the structure of the highly branched pulp and allows uniform dispersment into rubber formulations, helping to enable efficient reinforcement.

Features and Benefits:
- Kevlar® Engineered Elastomer reinforces differently from conventional fillers such as carbon black and silica by increasing stiffness (modulus) without a negative impact to hysteresis, which minimizes heat buildup, thereby improving durability.
- Laboratory and field-use performance trials conducted by Shaw Almex on pulley applications in North America demonstrate dramatic improvements in abrasion resistance, tear strength, modulus, and cut and chip resistance leading to longer wear life.

**AN INDUSTRY FIRST - Utilizing the Kevlar® Engineered Elastomer, Almex can offer an industry leading Five Year Tile Retention Warranty.**

##### A Premium Product

While there are many suppliers of pulley lagging and skirtboard rubber, most have sought to sacrifice quality and performance for sake of cost. Almex has taken a different strategy by offering a premium product with superior performance. This allows OEM companies such as pulley manufacturers to offer their customers an alternative that reduces downtime.

Products under the Engineered Elastomer line will feature both the Almex and DuPontTM Kevlar® logos prominently displayed, assuring the customer that they are receiving a product with superior life and performance.
